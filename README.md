# Online-Excel-Chartbuilder
An online data science tool for data visualization and predictive modeling (feature coming after visualizations). You can fork this project. Run pip install -r requirements.txt in your virtual environment. Launch the MongoDB server and enter the command "flask run" in your terminal to see how it currently works.

**Next plan**: Turn each directory into an API and serve the app with reactjs.

**Note**: I'm yet to add other charts, analysis/predictive features, and other features. Those are underway. Currently, you can access this app on https://excel-plot.herokuapp.com/. Loading may be slow at this point as the app is currently on free Heroku Dynos, which may take time to wake on request.
